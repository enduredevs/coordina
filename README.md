# 🟦 **Coordina**

### **The Coordination Layer for Modern Teams**

Coordina isn’t a “polling tool.”
It’s a **coordination engine** — built for teams, communities, and organizations that outgrow spreadsheets, Doodle clones, and chaotic group chats.

We’re building the **next-generation layer** for scheduling, availability orchestration, and decision alignment across distributed teams.

---

## 🚀 **What Coordina Solves**

Today's teams juggle:

* endless back-and-forth messages
* timezone mismatches
* stakeholder misalignment
* fragmented tools
* scattered availability data

Coordina replaces that chaos with a **central system-of-record for decisions and scheduling**, powered by smart, flexible polls.

---

## 🌐 **Why Coordina Exists**

Modern teams operate across:

* hybrid workplaces
* cross-functional squads
* async workflows
* global contributors

Yet the tooling around “when can we meet?”, “which option works best?”, and “how do we align quickly?” hasn’t evolved for the new world.

Coordina is built to be the missing piece:
**a lightweight, universal decision framework that adapts to any workflow.**

---

## ✨ **Core Features**

### 🗳️ **Intelligent Polls**

Create polls for:

* meeting times
* event scheduling
* decision options
* roadmap priorities
* team alignment

No friction. No accounts required for participants (optional).

---

### 🕒 **Smart Availability**

Coordina understands:

* time zones
* working hours
* daylight shifts
* blocked periods
* personal preferences

Results are optimized, not just tallied.

---

### 🤝 **Frictionless Participation**

Anyone can vote:

* via link
* email invites
* embedded widgets
* Slack/Teams integrations *(coming soon)*

No sign-in. No onboarding.
Just respond.

---

### 🔄 **Real-Time Decision Sync**

Every update syncs instantly.
No refresh buttons.
No ambiguous “who voted?” moments.

---

### 📊 **Clear Outcome Engine**

Coordina goes beyond “majority votes.”
It computes:

* best-fit option
* availability overlaps
* confidence scoring
* conflict detection
* consensus heatmaps

Teams align faster because the data guides them.

---

### 🔐 **Built for Trust**

* End-to-end secure
* No tracking bloat
* Privacy-first architecture
* Optional self-hosting (future roadmap)

---

## ⚙️ **Tech Stack**

Coordina is built on a modern, scalable stack:

* **Next.js** – App & UI
* **PostgreSQL** – Data layer
* **Prisma** – ORM
* **TypeScript** – End-to-end typing
* **Turborepo** – Monorepo performance
* **Vercel** – Blazing-fast deployments

Designed to scale from a small team to an enterprise workflow.

---

## 🧩 **The Vision**

Coordina is not just a tool — it’s a platform.

We’re building toward:

* Teamwide availability API
* Automated meeting orchestration
* Workflow-based decision trees
* Poll templates for every industry
* Slack/Teams/Notion embeds
* Analytics for team efficiency
* AI-assisted scheduling suggestions

Scheduling is the first step.
**Coordination is the mission.**
